CS 370 - Pirate Intelligent Agent

Project Overview
In this project, I worked with reinforcement learning and neural networks to develop an intelligent agent capable of navigating a pirate environment. The project involved training an agent using Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning techniques to optimize its decision-making.


 What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems using algorithms, data structures, and computational models. Their work powers industries from artificial intelligence to cybersecurity, impacting everyday life through technology.

 How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- Define the problem clearly.
- Break it into smaller components.
- Apply relevant computational techniques.
- Optimize and iterate for efficiency.

 What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
- Ensure fairness and transparency in AI models.
- Avoid bias in training data.
- Respect data privacy and security.
- Develop software that enhances, rather than harms, society.
